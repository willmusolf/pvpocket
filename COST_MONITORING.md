# ðŸš¨ Firebase Cost Crisis - RESOLVED

## Summary of Changes Made

### âœ… CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED (Aug 18, 2025)

1. **Cloud Scheduler Frequency Reduced (97% reduction)**:
   - `check-sets-job`: **HOURLY â†’ DAILY** (720 â†’ 30 runs/month)
   - `check-images-job`: **HOURLY â†’ WEEKLY** (720 â†’ 4 runs/month)
   - `check-icons-job`: **6-HOURLY â†’ WEEKLY** (120 â†’ 4 runs/month)
   - **Expected savings: ~$8/month immediately**

2. **Development Environment Protected**:
   - Local development no longer hits production Firebase
   - Background sync disabled for local development
   - Only runs in scraping jobs with `JOB_TYPE` environment variable

3. **Admin Dashboard Queries Optimized**:
   - Card queries: 2000 â†’ 10 documents (99.5% reduction)
   - User queries: 2000 â†’ 50 documents (97.5% reduction)
   - Uses sampling and estimation for dashboard metrics

## Cost Monitoring Dashboard

**Access your cost monitoring at:**
- http://localhost:5001/internal/firestore-usage (development)
- https://pvpocket.xyz/internal/firestore-usage (production)

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
- Daily Firestore reads/writes/deletes
- Estimated daily cost
- Cost trends by collection
- Automatic alerts at $2, $5 thresholds

## Expected Results

**Before fixes:**
- 1,560 scheduler executions/month
- 2000+ document queries in admin dashboard
- Local development hitting production Firebase
- **Cost: ~$10/month**

**After fixes:**
- 38 scheduler executions/month (97% reduction)
- 10-50 document queries in admin dashboard (99%+ reduction)
- Local development isolated from production
- **Expected cost: $1-2/month (80-90% reduction)**

## Monitoring Going Forward

### Daily Checks
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/internal/firestore-usage | jq '.summary.estimated_daily_cost'
```

### Weekly Review
- Check Firebase billing console
- Review `/internal/firestore-usage` for trends
- Ensure scheduler jobs are still on correct schedule

### Monthly Budget Alerts
Your existing $10 budget alert will notify you if costs rise again.
Consider lowering to $3-5 now that baseline is ~$1-2.

## Emergency Procedures

**If costs spike again:**

1. **Check Cloud Scheduler** (most likely cause):
   ```bash
   gcloud scheduler jobs list --project=pvpocket-dd286
   ```

2. **Temporarily disable schedulers**:
   ```bash
   gcloud scheduler jobs pause check-sets-job --project=pvpocket-dd286 --location=us-central1
   gcloud scheduler jobs pause check-images-job --project=pvpocket-dd286 --location=us-central1
   gcloud scheduler jobs pause check-icons-job --project=pvpocket-dd286 --location=us-central1
   ```

3. **Check for development environment issues**:
   - Ensure `SKIP_EMULATOR_SYNC=1` is set during local development
   - Use `python run.py --no-sync` if needed

## Cost Optimization Features

âœ… **Automatic cost monitoring and alerts**
âœ… **Emulator for free local development** 
âœ… **Query optimization with sampling**
âœ… **Background job frequency optimization**
âœ… **Development/production isolation**

Your Firebase costs should now be sustainable at $1-2/month instead of $10/month.
