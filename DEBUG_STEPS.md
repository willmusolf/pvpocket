# 🔍 Debug Steps for Email & Support Tickets

## Current Issues:
1. **Email test**: Shows "Testing email configuration..." but no response
2. **Support tickets**: Not loading, no visible error logs

## Quick Debug Steps:

### 1. First, install Flask-Mail in your virtual environment:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the venv and in the right directory
pip install Flask-Mail==0.10.0
```

### 2. Run the app with detailed logging:
```bash
python run.py
```

### 3. Test the endpoints directly:

**Test email config:**
```bash
# Open in browser (you must be logged in as admin first):
http://localhost:5001/admin/dashboard

# Then click "Test Email" button and check browser console (F12)
```

**Test support tickets:**
```bash
# In browser console, try:
fetch('/admin/api/support-tickets').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

### 4. Check logs in terminal:
Look for these log messages:
- "Initializing email service..."
- "Email credentials loaded securely" 
- "Fetching support tickets..."
- Any ERROR or WARNING messages

### 5. Create a test support ticket:
```bash
# Go to: http://localhost:5001/support
# Fill out the form and submit
# Then check if it appears in admin dashboard
```

## Expected Behavior:

### Email Test Should Show:
- ✅ Secret Manager: Connected (or error message)  
- ✅/❌ Email Credentials: Available/Not available
- ✅/❌ Email Service: Ready/Not configured

### Support Tickets Should:
- Load immediately when clicking "Support Tickets" tab
- Show tickets organized by status (New, In Progress, Resolved)
- Display "No tickets" message if empty

## If Still Not Working:

Check these files exist:
- `app/email_service.py` ✅
- `app/secret_manager_utils.py` ✅
- Flask-Mail installed ❓

Check browser network tab (F12 → Network) when:
- Clicking "Test Email" button
- Loading support tickets

Look for HTTP errors (404, 500, etc.) and response details.
