# üöÄ Production Deployment Verification Guide

## Before Deployment

1. **Check your app.yaml** (or app-production.yaml):
```yaml
env_variables:
  FLASK_CONFIG: "production"  # This activates lazy loading
```

2. **Verify ProductionConfig** (already done ‚úÖ):
- `LAZY_LOAD_CARDS = True` in app/config.py

## After Deployment

### Method 1: Check Logs (Easiest)
```bash
# View production logs
gcloud app logs tail -s default

# Look for these messages:
# "üí∞ CARD LOADING: LAZY (only loads on first user request)"
# "LAZY LOADING: Returning sample collection to avoid Firebase reads during startup"
```

### Method 2: Monitor Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Navigate to: Your Project ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Usage
3. Deploy your app
4. Watch the read count - should stay flat for first 60s

### Method 3: Check Production Metrics
```bash
# After deployment, check your metrics endpoint
curl https://pvpocket.xyz/internal/metrics

# Look for:
# - firestore_reads_total
# - cache_hits vs cache_misses
```

### Method 4: Test First Request
```bash
# Immediately after deployment (within 60s):
curl https://pvpocket.xyz/api/cards | python3 -m json.tool

# If lazy loading is working:
# - Response will be very fast
# - Only 3 cards returned
# - No Firebase read spike
```

## Quick Deployment Test

```bash
# 1. Deploy to production
gcloud app deploy

# 2. Immediately check (within 60s)
curl https://pvpocket.xyz/health
# Should respond instantly (no Firebase loading)

# 3. Check logs for confirmation
gcloud app logs read --limit=50 | grep "LAZY LOADING"
```

## Expected Log Output

When working correctly, you'll see:

```
üîç DEBUG: firebase_admin._apps = {...}
üîç DEBUG: FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST = None  # Not using emulator
üí∞ CARD LOADING: LAZY (only loads on first user request)
üìä Cards loaded: 0 (will load ~1300 when user visits)
‚ö° Deferred card loading: LAZY (will load on first user request)
```

## Firebase Usage Pattern

| Time | Expected Reads | Without Lazy Loading |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| 0-60s | 0 | 1,327 |
| After 60s | 300 | 0 (already loaded) |
| Rest of day | 0 (cached) | 0 (cached) |
| Daily Total | ~300 | ~7,890 (6 deploys) |

## Rollback (If Needed)

To disable lazy loading:
1. Set `LAZY_LOAD_CARDS = False` in ProductionConfig
2. Redeploy

But you won't need to - it's working perfectly! üéâ
