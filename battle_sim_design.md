# Pok√©mon TCG Pocket Battle Simulator Design

## Overview
This document describes the architecture, core mechanics, and implementation plan for a comprehensive Pok√©mon TCG Pocket battle simulator integrated with the existing Pokemon TCG Pocket web application.

## Core Rules & Mechanics

### Deck Rules
- **Deck Size**: Exactly 20 cards
- **Card Copies**: Maximum 2 copies of any card with the same name
- **Starting Hand**: Must contain at least 1 Basic Pok√©mon (no mulligans)
- **Valid Deck**: Must contain at least 1 Basic Pok√©mon

### Battle Setup
- **Hand Size**: Maximum 10 cards
- **Bench Size**: Maximum 3 Pok√©mon
- **Energy**: 1 energy attachment per turn
- **Multi-color Decks**: Energy type selected randomly from deck types each turn
- **Zero Energy Attacks**: Legal and require no energy cost

### Turn Structure
1. **Player 1 Turn 1 Restriction**: Cannot attach energy unless card effect allows
2. **Energy Attachment**: 1 per turn, type based on deck types (random for multi-type)
3. **Attack Phase**: Choose attack, calculate damage, apply effects
4. **Knockout Handling**: If Pokemon is knocked out, defending player must immediately select replacement
5. **End Turn**: Check win conditions, switch active player

### Damage & Combat
- **Weakness**: +20 damage (configurable)
- **Attack Damage**: Based on card attack values
- **KO System**: Pok√©mon with HP ‚â§ 0 are knocked out
- **Prize Points**: 1 point per KO, 2 points for EX Pok√©mon
- **Forced Replacement**: When active Pokemon is knocked out, player must immediately choose replacement from bench or hand

### Win/Tie Conditions
- **Win**: First player to reach 3 prize points
- **Tie**: Both players unable to continue (no bench Pok√©mon available)
- **Turn Limit**: 100 turns maximum (tie if reached)

```

## Core Components

### GameState Class
```python
class GameState:
    # Game tracking
    turn_number: int
    current_player: int  # 0 or 1
    winner: Optional[int]
    is_tie: bool
    
    # Player states
    players: List[PlayerState]
    
    # Game configuration
    config: RulesConfig
    
    # Logging
    turn_log: List[Dict]
    rng_seed: Optional[int]
```

### PlayerState Class
```python
class PlayerState:
    # Identity
    player_id: int
    deck: Deck
    
    # Game state
    hand: List[Card]
    bench: List[Optional[BattlePokemon]]  # Max 3, None = empty slot
    active_pokemon: Optional[BattlePokemon]
    prize_points: int
    
    # Turn state
    energy_attached_this_turn: bool
    energy_types_available: List[str]
```

### BattlePokemon Class
```python
class BattlePokemon:
    # Card reference
    card: Card
    
    # Battle state
    current_hp: int
    max_hp: int
    energy_attached: List[str]
    
    # Status effects (future expansion)
    status_effects: List[str]
```

### RulesConfig Class
```python
class RulesConfig:
    # Configurable rules
    weakness_damage_bonus: int = 20
    max_hand_size: int = 10
    max_bench_size: int = 3
    max_deck_size: int = 20
    max_card_copies: int = 2
    max_prize_points: int = 3
    max_turns: int = 100
    
    # Energy rules
    energy_per_turn: int = 1
    player_1_no_energy_turn_1: bool = True
```

## Game Flow

### Initialization
1. Validate both decks (20 cards, ‚â§2 copies, ‚â•1 Basic)
2. Shuffle decks with optional seed for reproducibility
3. Draw starting hands (ensure ‚â•1 Basic Pok√©mon)
4. Each player places 1 Basic Pok√©mon as Active
5. Initialize game state and logging

### Turn Sequence
1. **Start of Turn**
   - Check if player can continue (has Active Pok√©mon)
   - Log turn start
   
2. **Energy Phase**
   - Attach 1 energy if allowed (not Player 1 Turn 1)
   - For multi-type decks, randomly select energy type
   
3. **Action Phase**
   - AI or player selects action (attack, play card, etc.)
   - For Phase 1: AI always attacks if possible
   
4. **Attack Resolution**
   - Validate attack requirements (energy cost)
   - Calculate damage (base + weakness bonus)
   - Apply damage, check for KO
   - If KO occurs, trigger forced Pokemon selection
   - Award prize points for KO
   
5. **Forced Pokemon Selection** (if knockout occurred)
   - Game enters FORCED_POKEMON_SELECTION phase
   - Defending player must choose replacement Pokemon
   - Options: Pokemon from bench or Basic Pokemon from hand
   - Turn continues after selection is made
   
6. **End of Turn**
   - Check win conditions
   - Switch to next player (only if no forced selection pending)
   - Increment turn counter

### Win Condition Checking
1. **Prize Points**: Player reaches 3 points
2. **No Active Pok√©mon**: Opponent cannot continue
3. **Turn Limit**: 100 turns reached (declare tie)
4. **Both Unable**: Both players cannot continue (tie)

## AI Implementation (Phase 1)

### Rule-Based AI Strategy
```python
class RuleBasedAI:
    def choose_action(self, game_state: GameState, player_id: int) -> Action:
        # Priority order:
        # 1. Place Basic Pok√©mon if active slot empty
        # 2. Attach energy if available
        # 3. Attack with highest damage possible
        # 4. End turn if no valid actions
```

### AI Decision Logic
1. **Forced Pokemon Selection**: When active Pokemon is knocked out, choose replacement with highest HP/energy score
2. **Pok√©mon Placement**: Always place Basic Pok√©mon if active slot is empty
3. **Energy Attachment**: Attach to Active Pok√©mon if available
4. **Attack Selection**: Choose attack that deals most damage to opponent
5. **Target Selection**: Always target opponent's Active Pok√©mon

## Logging System

### Turn Logging (JSONL Format)
```json
{
  "turn": 1,
  "player": 0,
  "action": "attach_energy",
  "details": {"energy_type": "Fire", "target": "active"},
  "game_state": {
    "player_0_active_hp": 60,
    "player_1_active_hp": 70,
    "player_0_bench_count": 1,
    "player_1_bench_count": 2
  }
}
```

### Battle Summary
```json
{
  "battle_id": "uuid",
  "winner": 0,
  "is_tie": false,
  "total_turns": 15,
  "final_scores": [3, 1],
  "duration_seconds": 0.045,
  "deck_types": [["Fire"], ["Water", "Lightning"]],
  "rng_seed": 12345
}
```

## Integration Points
