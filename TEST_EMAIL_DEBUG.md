# üîç Email Debug Test - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Final Status:
- ‚úÖ Gmail App Password fixed: Unicode characters removed
- ‚úÖ Secret Manager working perfectly
- ‚úÖ Email credentials properly cleaned (20 chars ‚Üí 16 chars)
- ‚úÖ SMTP authentication working
- ‚úÖ Email service initialized successfully

## Issue Resolution:
The problem was a Unicode non-breaking space character (\xa0) in the stored Gmail App Password that was breaking ASCII encoding during SMTP authentication.

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced `secret_manager_utils.py` with regex-based whitespace cleaning
- Removes all Unicode whitespace including non-breaking spaces
- Ensures only ASCII characters in passwords
- Password successfully cleaned from 20 to 16 characters

## Verification Steps (COMPLETED):

### 1. Restart the app:
```bash
python run.py
```

### 2. Try sending a test email reply:
- Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Support Tickets
- Click "Quick Reply" on any ticket
- Type a test message
- Click "Send Reply"

### 3. Check the terminal logs:
Look for these new detailed logs:
```
Email config check - Username: willmusolf***
Email config check - Password length: 19
Email config check - Mail server: smtp.gmail.com
Email config check - Mail port: 587
Email config check - Mail TLS: True
Attempting to send email to: user@example.com
Email subject: Re: Test Subject
Email message created, attempting to send via SMTP...
```

### 4. If it fails, check for these common Gmail errors:
- "Username and Password not accepted" ‚Üí App Password issue
- "Less secure app access" ‚Üí Need to use App Password (not regular password)
- "SMTP authentication" ‚Üí Gmail 2FA settings
- Connection timeout ‚Üí Network/firewall issue

### 5. Quick Gmail App Password Check:
The current password `dljj bbzs ldxa pfck` should work if:
- ‚úÖ It's a valid 16-character Gmail App Password
- ‚úÖ Generated for your `willmusolf@gmail.com` account
- ‚úÖ Your Gmail has 2-factor authentication enabled

### Expected Fix:
The detailed logs will show exactly where the email sending fails, so we can fix the specific issue!
