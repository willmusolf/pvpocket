```

### Test Configuration

- **pytest.ini**: Main test configuration with coverage settings
- **conftest.py**: Shared test fixtures and setup
- **Firebase Emulator**: Used for safe testing without affecting production data

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)

**Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation

**Coverage**:
- Cache manager functionality
- Data models and utilities
- Service layer components
- Helper functions

**Example**:
```python
def test_cache_hit_rate(cache_manager, mock_user_data):
    # Test cache performance and reliability
    success = cache_manager.set_user_data("test-user", mock_user_data)
    assert success is True
    
    retrieved = cache_manager.get_user_data("test-user")
    assert retrieved["email"] == mock_user_data["email"]
```

### 2. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)

**Purpose**: Test API endpoints and cross-component functionality

**Coverage**:
- API response formats and status codes
- Authentication and authorization
- Database interactions
- Error handling

**Example**:
```python
def test_cards_api_endpoint(client, mock_card_data):
    response = client.get('/api/cards')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    data = json.loads(response.data)
    assert isinstance(data, list)
```

### 3. Security Tests (`tests/security/`)

**Purpose**: Identify and prevent security vulnerabilities

**Coverage**:
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Security headers presence
- Input validation and XSS prevention
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Firebase security rules validation

**Example**:
```python
def test_rate_limiting_exists(client):
    # Test rate limiting works
    responses = []
    for i in range(20):  # Excessive requests
        response = client.get('/api/cards')
        responses.append(response.status_code)
    
    assert 429 in responses, "Rate limiting not implemented"
```

### 4. Performance Tests (`tests/performance/`)

**Purpose**: Ensure application meets performance requirements

**Coverage**:
- Response time benchmarks
- Concurrent user handling
- Cache performance metrics
- Memory usage validation
- Startup time optimization

**Example**:
```python
def test_concurrent_requests(client):
    def make_request():
        return client.get('/health')
    
    # Simulate 10 concurrent users
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(make_request) for _ in range(10)]
        results = [future.result() for future in futures]
    
    success_rate = len([r for r in results if r.status_code == 200]) / 10 * 100
    assert success_rate >= 95
```

## Security Testing

### Rate Limiting Tests

- **API Rate Limits**: 100 requests/minute for standard API endpoints
- **Heavy Operations**: 10 requests/minute for resource-intensive operations
- **Authentication**: 5 requests/minute for login attempts

### Security Headers Tests

Validates presence of:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

### Firebase Security Rules Tests

- **Firestore Rules**: User data isolation, proper authentication
- **Storage Rules**: Image access controls, file size limits
- **Authentication**: Email verification requirements

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Requirements

| Endpoint Type | Max Response Time | Target |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Health Check | 100ms | 50ms |
| API Endpoints | 500ms | 200ms |
| Card Collection | 1000ms | 300ms |
| Authentication | 2000ms | 1000ms |

### Concurrency Requirements

- **Concurrent Users**: Support 10+ simultaneous users
- **Success Rate**: ≥95% under normal load
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ≥90% for cached operations

### Memory Usage

- **Cache Memory**: <10MB for test datasets
- **Startup Time**: <3 seconds (optimized from 5-10s)

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow (Optimized Strategy)

**Development Branch Pushes & Pull Requests → Fast Tests Only**:
- Uses `tests/test_fast_development.py` with mocked data (<5 seconds)
- No Firebase emulator overhead - pure speed for development feedback
- Essential tests: API endpoints, authentication, security headers, basic performance
- Provides immediate feedback for development iterations

**Main Branch Pushes (Production Deployment) → Full Test Suite**:
- Starts Firebase emulators with real data
- Seeds test data for comprehensive testing  
- Tests actual Firebase operations and data persistence
- Complete validation before production deployment (~20-30 seconds)

**Manual Triggers → Flexible**:
- Can run fast, full, unit, security, or performance tests via GitHub Actions UI

**Security Scanning** (Both scenarios):
- Python dependency vulnerabilities (Safety)
- Code analysis for security issues (Bandit)
- Linting and code quality checks

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Both test types
FLASK_CONFIG=testing
SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key-for-ci
REFRESH_SECRET_KEY=test-refresh-key-for-ci

# Full tests only
FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080
FIREBASE_STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9199
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1
```

### Test Environment Security

- **No Production Data**: All tests use Firebase emulators
- **Isolated Environment**: Test environment completely separated from production
- **Secure Credentials**: No hardcoded secrets or fake credentials
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Emulators reset between test runs

## Running Tests

### Local Development Strategy

**For Daily Development (Recommended)**:
```bash
# Super fast tests - like development branch CI (<5 seconds)
./scripts/run_tests.sh fast
# or directly: pytest tests/test_fast_development.py -v

# All fast tests with mocks
./scripts/run_tests.sh dev
```

**Before Pushing to Main Branch (Pre-Production)**:
```bash
# Run the same comprehensive tests as production deployment
./scripts/run_tests.sh pre-prod

# This will:
# 1. Start Firebase emulator
# 2. Seed test data  
# 3. Run all tests including integration tests
# 4. Generate coverage report
# 5. Clean up emulator
```

**Specific Test Categories**:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v          # Unit tests only
python -m pytest tests/security/ -v      # Security tests only
python -m pytest tests/performance/ -v   # Performance tests only

# Full test suite (if emulator is already running)
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

**Quick Development Workflow**:
1. Make changes
2. Run `./scripts/run_tests.sh fast` (5 seconds)
3. If tests pass, push to development branch
4. Before merging to main, run `./scripts/run_tests.sh pre-prod` locally

### CI/CD Environment

**Optimized Test Strategy**:
- **Development Branch & PRs**: Fast tests only (~5 seconds) with mocked data
- **Main Branch (Production)**: Full test suite (~20-30 seconds) with Firebase emulator
- **Manual Triggers**: Can run specific test types via workflow dispatch

**Test Flow**:
```
Feature Branch → PR (Fast) → Development (Fast) → Main (Full) → Production Deploy
```

**Key Benefits**:
- Development iterations are extremely fast
- Production deployments are thoroughly validated
- Local testing can match production requirements

### Test Markers

```bash
# Run only fast tests
python -m pytest -m "not slow"

# Run only security tests
python -m pytest -m security

# Run only unit tests
python -m pytest -m unit

# Run performance tests (may be slow)
python -m pytest -m performance
```

## Test Environment Access

### Security Considerations

- **Test Environment**: `https://test-env-dot-pvpocket-dd286.uc.r.appspot.com`
- **Authentication**: Same Google OAuth as production
- **Data Isolation**: Separate Firebase project for testing
- **Access Control**: Internal development team only

### CI/CD Test Access

- **GitHub Actions**: Uses Firebase emulators, no real data access
- **Test Reports**: Uploaded as CI artifacts, accessible to team
- **Security Scanning**: Results automatically reviewed in PR checks

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Test Failure Alerts

- **Email Notifications**: On CI/CD test failures
- **GitHub Status**: PR checks prevent merging on failures
- **Coverage Requirements**: Must maintain 80% code coverage

### Performance Regression Detection

- **Automated Benchmarking**: Response time tracking in CI
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Prevents memory leaks
- **Security Regression**: Prevents security vulnerabilities

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests

1. **Use Fixtures**: Leverage shared test data and setup
2. **Mock External Services**: Firebase emulator for safe testing
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Include error conditions and boundary cases
4. **Security First**: Always test authentication and authorization
5. **Performance Aware**: Include timing assertions for critical paths

### Security Testing

1. **Rate Limiting**: Test all API endpoints for proper limits
2. **Input Validation**: Test XSS, injection, and malformed data
3. **Authentication**: Test bypass attempts and privilege escalation
4. **Headers**: Validate all security headers are present
5. **Firebase Rules**: Test data access controls thoroughly

### Performance Testing

1. **Realistic Load**: Use appropriate concurrency levels
2. **Memory Monitoring**: Check for leaks and excessive usage
3. **Cache Effectiveness**: Validate hit rates and performance
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure graceful degradation under load

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase Emulator Not Starting**:
   ```bash
   # Kill existing processes
   pkill -f firebase
   # Restart emulators
   firebase emulators:start --only firestore,storage
   ```

2. **Test Database State**:
   ```bash
   # Emulators automatically reset between runs
   # For persistent issues, clear Firebase cache
   firebase emulators:exec --only firestore "python -m pytest tests/"
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting in Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Tests may hit rate limits during development
   # Use test-specific limits or markers to skip
   python -m pytest -m "not rate_limit"
   ```

This testing architecture provides comprehensive coverage while maintaining security and performance standards. The migration from the old test files (test_scalability.py, test_quick.py) to this structured approach provides better maintainability, security, and reliability.

## Firebase Cost Considerations

### Does Firebase charge for reads during redeployment?

**Short answer**: No, Firebase itself doesn't charge for reads during App Engine redeployment, but there are some nuances:

**App Engine Deployment Process**:
- App Engine creates new instances and routes traffic to them
- Old instances are gradually terminated
- No additional Firebase operations are triggered by the deployment itself
- Your application's startup code may perform Firebase reads (e.g., loading configuration)

**Potential Costs During Deployment**:
1. **Startup reads**: If your app loads data on startup (like card collections), these count as normal reads
2. **Health checks**: App Engine health checks may trigger Firebase reads if your `/health` endpoint queries Firebase
3. **Instance scaling**: New instances starting up may each load configuration or cache data

**Cost Optimization Tips**:
- Use caching to minimize repeated Firebase reads during instance startup
- Consider lazy loading for non-critical data
- Monitor Firebase usage at `/internal/firestore-usage` during deployments
- Pre-warm critical data during deployment rather than on-demand loading

**Typical deployment cost**: <$0.01 for small applications due to minimal additional reads beyond normal startup operations.
