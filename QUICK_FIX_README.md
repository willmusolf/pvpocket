# 🚀 Quick Fix Applied!

## ✅ **Issue Fixed: Application Context Error**

The email service initialization was failing because it tried to use `current_app.logger` before the Flask app was fully ready.

### **What I Fixed:**
- ✅ Added fallback logging to `print()` when app context isn't available
- ✅ Added environment variable fallback for GCP_PROJECT_ID
- ✅ Wrapped all `current_app` calls in try/except blocks

### **Now Try:**

**1. Restart your app:**
```bash
python run.py
```

**2. You should see these messages instead of errors:**
```
Attempting to fetch secret: mail-username from project: pvpocket-dd286
Successfully retrieved secret: mail-username (length: 21)
```

**3. Test the features:**

**Email Test:**
- Go to `http://localhost:5001/admin/dashboard`
- Click "Test Email" button
- Should now work without 404 errors

**Support Tickets:**
- Click "Support Tickets" tab
- Should load properly with detailed logging

### **Expected Behavior:**

**Email Test Results:**
- ✅ Secret Manager: Connected
- ✅ Email Credentials: Available (Secret Manager) 
- ❌ Email Service: Not configured (until you add real Gmail App Password)

**Support Tickets:**
- Should load and display (even if empty)
- Console should show "Loaded X tickets"

### **Next Steps:**

1. **If email test shows credentials available** → Email system is working!
2. **If you want to actually send emails** → Update the mail-password secret with your real Gmail App Password:
   ```bash
   gcloud secrets versions add mail-password --data-file=<(echo "your-real-16-char-password") --project=pvpocket-dd286
   ```

The system is now properly configured and should work without application context errors! 🎉
