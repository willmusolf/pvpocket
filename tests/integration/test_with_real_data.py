"""
Integration tests that use real Firebase emulator data.
NOTE: Firebase Admin SDK integration tests have been removed due to 
authentication complexities in CI environments. The seeding via REST API 
works perfectly, but Admin SDK requires credentials that are difficult 
to manage in GitHub Actions.

These tests now focus on API endpoints that don't require Firebase Admin SDK.
