4. Iterate based on results
```

**Example Commands:**
```bash
# Take screenshot of current deck builder
Use playwright to navigate to localhost:5002/decks and take a screenshot

# Test responsive design
Use playwright to navigate to localhost:5002/collection and take screenshots at mobile (375x667), tablet (768x1024), and desktop (1920x1080) viewports

# Test authentication flow
Use playwright to navigate to localhost:5002, click login, and take a screenshot of the OAuth flow
```

### 2. Frontend-Specialist + Playwright Integration

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- **Real-time Visual Feedback**: Immediate screenshots after UI changes
- **Cross-device Testing**: Automated responsive design validation
- **Interactive Testing**: Test clicks, forms, and user interactions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measure page load times and identify bottlenecks

**Workflow Example:**
```
You: "Improve the deck builder layout for mobile devices"
‚Üí Frontend-specialist makes CSS/HTML changes
‚Üí "Use playwright to test the deck builder on mobile viewport and take screenshots"
‚Üí Review visual results and iterate
```
